Hi! I'm a 1st year PhD student in Mathematics at Queen's University. I study reinforcement learning and control theory under Prof. Bahman Gharesifard.  

Before starting at Queen's, I was a utilities analyst at Toronto Hydro. Prior to that, I completed my MASc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto.

Outside of academics, I enjoy roadrunning, reading, and baking sourdough bread. This webpage is being actively developed as of Fall 2025, so please check back soon for updates.
